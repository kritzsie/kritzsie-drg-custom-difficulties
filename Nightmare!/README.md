# Nightmare!
*Nightmare!* is a difficulty that attempts to bring together some of the best ideas from a variety of custom hazard levels.

The goal is to provide a fun and challenging experience for players of varying skill levels, so bugs aren't as tanky as Hazard 6, but spawn in numbers large enough to easily overwhelm a team of dwarves. There are also some spicy additions which are best experienced blind.

For a spoiler-free experience, skip this document until you've tried a couple of missions on this difficulty.

Enjoy!

## Custom Difficulty files

### 5 - Nightmare!
This is probably the one you want. Lots of bugs, lots of chaos!

### 4 - Ultra-Violence
*Hurt me plenty* (see below) with only twice the amount of spawns, or HMPx2. "Hard" difficulty.

### 3 - Hurt me plenty
*Nightmare!* itself is based on this difficulty. Bugs spawn in much smaller numbers here, akin to a vanilla Hazard level. HMP is like a "normal" difficulty.
